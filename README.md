# Why hectorgrey?

The username comes from two sources - I'm a fan of fantasy, and I also like some of Steven King's novels.
hector comes from the name of King Arthur's foster father, Sir Hector (or Ector as it was spelled when La
Morte d'Arthur was being written), while grey comes from the name of the monster in Steven King's
Dreamcatcher - Mr. Grey (which was probably spelled Gray in the book, but it's a long time since I read it
and I prefer the British spelling).
